 ## building requires signing.
 ## open MyApp.xcworkspace in xcode and sign the project for your team
 ## trying xcode 10.3
 ## version incompatibility. Trying xcode 11. Succeeded!
 ## I guess I need xproj, not xcworkspace ?
 ## From the beginning:
 ic platform rm ios
 ic platform add ios
 ic plugin add cordova-plugin-facebook4 --variable APP_ID="3016949928380365" --variable APP_NAME="gameui.piousbox.com"

 ## then, sign  (xcode 11)
 ## then, `pod install`
 ## deployment target is ios 13.1
 ## drag CoreKit to xcode, build again
 ## run on iPhone 8 simulator - but it's ios 9, let's try hardware again
 ## `pod install` gives me a corrupted version (mismatch)
 ## does dragging the framework into xcode work? Nope

 ## opening xcode 10, xcodeproj
 ## building for hardware phone
 ## opening xcworkspace instead - build succeeded!
 ## I HAVE TO KILL DOCKER TO MAKE IT WORK?!
 ## xcode 11, emulator 12.4, runs.
 ## next, let's run it on hardware
 ## switched build target to 13.2
 # rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

 ## removing fb from all of this

Also:

<pre>
  cd platform/ios
  sudo gem instal cocoapods
  pod install
